# AI-Server
An HTTP server who responded to post requests containing images the result of running a pre-trained model on them.

## Notes:

(Circa August 2021)  
At the time I was testing the feasibility of executing machine learning models on advanced hardware by querying them over the internet. To do so I developed this server who responded to properly formatted requests with the output of a specific pre-trained model. In this case, the test was digit recognition.
